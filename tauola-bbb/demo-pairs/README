Demo of tauola-BBB presenting channel adding and redefinition

NOTE:
This example is based on demo-redefine with only small differences:
- Several .c and .h files are added or expanded presenting the new functionality.

Through edition of iniofc.c file user can select new channels to be selected for use.
We assume here that user is familiar with examples from demo-redefine.
Two examples are commented out. They are prepared for testing purposes,
but may serve as good baseline to build own models.
