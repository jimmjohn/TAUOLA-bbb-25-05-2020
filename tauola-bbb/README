==============

1 Installation
==============
This is a standalone package. 
To run default examples simply execute:
"make"
"make run"
in any of the tauola-bbb/demo-* directories.

More sophisticated exampes may require MC-Tester (see reference [arXiv::0812.3215]) and associated with it other programs.
User has to provide path in the makefile to his MC-Tester installation at his own discretion.

To use tauola-bbb content in other projects follow instructions (README files) from
dedicated tauola-bbb/patch-* folders
NOTE: if instructions of patch-babar-validation are followed, changes of files of the installation are introduced.
      Be sure to backup tauola-bbb folder as well as photos/photos.f file 
      for easy restoration of the original files. 

The compilation configurations are set in the adequate Makefiles.
